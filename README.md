A Kotlin Multiplatform library for working with Nostr, with support for JVM, Android, Linux, MacOS/iOS.

Note: This is still in development and very incomplete.


## What is Nostr?
* An introduction or description of Nostr can be found [here](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr).
* The Nostr protocol specs can be found [here](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips).

## How to include the libary
  Inside your root-level `build.gradle(.kts)` file, you should add `jitpack`:
  ``` kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
    // ...
}
```

or

``` groovy
// build.gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    // ...
}
```

In newer projects, you need to also update the `settings.gradle(.kts)` file's `dependencyResolutionManagement` block:

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }  // <--
        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
    }
}
```
then, in your module's `build.gradle(.kts)`, you need to add:
```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    //...
    implementation("com.github.KotlinGeekDev.kostr:kostr-core:v1.0-beta-06")

}

```
If you're including it in an Android app, you can just add:
```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts
dependencies {
    //...
    implementation("com.github.KotlinGeekDev.kostr:kostr-core-android:v1.0-beta-06")

}
```

## Usage
When publishing an event, or making a subscription/close request to a relay, 
[`ClientMessage`](kostr-core/src/commonMain/kotlin/ktnostr/nostr/client/ClientMessage.kt) is used to encode the request/event,
and anything sent by a relay is encoded as a [`RelayMessage`](kostr-core/src/commonMain/kotlin/ktnostr/nostr/relay/RelayMessage.kt).</p>
Relays can be configured using a `RelayPool`, 
and actual communication with relays is done with the `NostrService`.</p>
You can setup the NostrService with/without a custom relay pool as follows:
```kotlin
// With a custom relay pool. 
val requestRelays = RelayPool.fromUrls("wss://relay1", "wss://relay2")
val clientService = NostrService(
    relayPool = requestRelays
)

//Without a custom pool(using the default pool)
val service = NostrService()
```
Note that if you need to do anything custom, such as using read-only relays,
you will need to setup the list of relays, then use them in the relay pool:
```kotlin
val customRelays = listOf(
    Relay("wss://relay1", readPolicy = true, writePolicy = false), // <-- A relay with custom read/write policy.
    Relay("wss://relay2"),
)

val customPool = RelayPool(relays = customRelays)
```
### Making a subscription request
In order to make a subscription request, you need to construct a `RequestMessage`.
And to do that, you need to pass in a subscriptionId(just a string), and a `NostrFilter`:
```kotlin
val postsByFiatjafFilter = NostrFilter.newFilter()
                    .kinds(listOf(EventKind.TEXT_NOTE.kind)) // <-- Looking for posts. Other kinds can be added
                    .authors(listOf("3bf0c63fcb93463407af97a5e5ee64fa883d107ef9e558472c4eb9aaaefa459d")) // <-- The profiles for which we want to find the posts(as indicated by .kinds() above)
                    .limit(20) // <-- Setting a limit is important, to avoid issues with relays
                    .build()

val myRequest = RequestMessage(
    subscriptionId = "fiatjaf_posts",
    filters = listOf(postsByFiatjafFilter)
)
```
Now, you can use the `NostrService` to make the request, either using `request()` or `requestWithResult()`. 
They are both `suspend` functions, and as such, should be called within the appropriate context.</p>
**Note**: `requestWithResult` terminates the connection(s) after receiving all the expected messages. This behaviour could be 
modified in the future.

The `request()` function has a set of callbacks which are used to handle the incoming messages,
`onRelayMessage: suspend (Relay, RelayMessage)`, as well as callbacks for handling errors, `onRequestError(Relay, Throwable)`.
An example is given below:
```kotlin
// Example coroutine scope
val appScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.IO)
//Using request() --
appScope.launch {
    clientService.request(
        myRequest, 
        onRequestError = { relay, throwable -> handleError(relay, throwable) }
    ) { relay: Relay, received: RelayMessage ->  // This is a suspend callback, so suspend functions can be used here.
        useMessage(relay, received)
    }
}
```
The `requestWithResult()` function returns a list of events(`List<Event>`), no matter the errors that occur
during its execution. The function however displays the errors using standard output. This may be changed in the future.
```kotlin
//Using requestWithResult() ---
// - Assuming a suspending context:
val events = clientService.requestWithResult(myRequest)
// OR, following with the request() example above:
appScope.launch {
  val events = clientService.requestWithResult(myRequest)  
}
```
